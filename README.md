pybeagle
========

Wrapper to https://github.com/beagle-dev/beagle-lib. Very much a work in progress.
The cython code that wraps the library is in `pybeagle_hand.pyx`. Other .pyx and .pxd
were attempts at automatically generating the wrapper boilerplate using autowrap. It
didn't quite work out in this case.
